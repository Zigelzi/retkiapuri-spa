# Retkiapuri
Retkiapuri's purpose is to help hikers to find and browse hiking routes in Finland and prepare for their hikes better.

---

## How to set up
Retkiapuri consists of three parts currently
* Retkiapuri (Main) - Docker-Composer for building all services independantly 
* Retkiapuri SPA - Single-Page Application for front-end built with Vue
* Retkiapuri API - Python (Flask) based backend API for managing the data

All three parts are needed to get the application running. Retkiapuri (Main) has the NGINX routing and build instructions for the services, and the SPA/API repositories are used to keep the backend/frontend development separate.
